foxpro-brackets
=================

[Visual FoxPro](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms950411.aspx) syntax highlighter for [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).

This extension "adapts" a  new CodeMirror mode named `nunjucks` by `axelboc.  The FoxPro mode overlays the standard html mix of syntax hilighters.  The `foxpro` mode is mapped to the following file extensions:

- `prg`

Note that this is a *very* rough implementation, which will not cover all FoxPro grammer.
